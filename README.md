# Jarv
macOS computer vision mapping hand gestures to mouse + keyboard control.

## How to run after cloning
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 air_mouse.py
```

Note: you will likely have popups when first run asking for permission to use the camera and whatnot. Accept and run again. I pinky promise that I'm not recording you.
